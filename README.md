# Team 3646 2019 Season Robot Control Software ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/bleep-bloop-yellow.svg)

This is the control software of FRC Team INTEGRA 3646's 2019 robot 'Black Mamba'.  
The kinematic models for autonomous path generation & following are borrowed from (with adjustments, of course) [Team 254](https://github.com/Team254)'s [2018 robot code](https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2018-Public) since the two robots shared similar mechanical properties.
